# seaice
A study on extent sea ice from 1975 to 2015. Working in R and Python for comparison.

Currently all I want to do is some basic statistical analysis:
 - find and graph annual mean and median, compare the two
 - quantify trends -- when are the lows/highs, how does the annual trend change overtime
 - identify outliers based on most appropriate definition (will use boxplot for now because I am a noob)
 
Next, I want to make some prediction models and see which reaches the highest accuracy in the following scenarios:
 - Trained on all available data, tested on 2016
 - Trained on 1978 to 2009, tested on 2010 to 2016
 - Trained on 1978 to 2000, tested on 2001 to 2016
 
 More work TBD
